Code Club Project Viewer
========================

View Code Club projects in the browser.

Features
--------

 * Paginated! (with custom breakpoints)
 * `li`s rendered with checkable checkboxes! (and maybe an alert `on next` if not all checkboxes checked)
 * Parse arbitrary markdown files! (so small changes can be made quickly and easily)
 * github hosted! (that’s the plan, anyway)

Motivation
----------

 * The printing is costing me a fortune
 * The printing is not environmentally friendly
 * Reading documentation on the screen is a totally normal thing to do
 * The checkboxes in the instructions are great, but my club members don’t use them. A lot of the questions they ask are a result of skipping instructions.
 * There are sometimes (quite rarely) small errors in the instructions. I can fix these in markdown, but the pdf render is so much prettier / has sensible breakpoints that I usually just print it with the errors :(

TODO
----

This is not even a WIP – I haven’t started it yet! I’m just leaving this here in case anyone else wants to have a go :)
